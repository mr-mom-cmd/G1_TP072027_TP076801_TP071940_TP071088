# G1_TP072027_TP076801_TP071940_TP071088

Job Matching Component (CT077-3-2-DSTR)

* To implement custom **Array** and **Linked List** data structures without using built-in containers (`<vector>` / `<list>`).
* To apply **search**, **sort**, and **filter** algorithms to real-world data.
* To develop a **job-matching algorithm** that links candidates to suitable job roles.
* To compare **time and memory efficiency** between the two structures.
